# HamBot
Discord server bot created for friends to coordinate gaming activities. My first bot :)

This bot automatically detects when server members request to play a certain game ("Valorant") using certain keywords.
On detection, it sends a message that users can interact with to confirm their availability for the game.
When enough users confirm, a notification is sent to all players to regroup and begin their game.

The bot also features the Plant minigame, where server members work together to nurture a plant and harvest its fruits to sell within a server-wide economy.
